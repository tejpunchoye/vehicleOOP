Inheritance is used to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class from the child class by using the keyword extends.
Encapsulation: Hiding attributes by using private access modifier and using getter() and setter() methods to access the attributes.
Polymorphism method Overriding: Process of declaring a method in the child class that is already existed in the parent class so that the child class can have its own implementation.
	Method Overriding - the methods will have the same signature
	
Ploymorphism method Overloading - 
	Method Overloading - Apart from having different parameters from 2 or more methods, the method signature will be the same.

Abstraction is used to create class that cannot be instantiated. Along with inheritance the child class will be forced to override the abstract methods from the parent class.
	Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

Super keyword is used to represent the parent class object from the child class.
	
A *VehicleType* can transport *transporting* number of passengers at
a maximum speed of *maxSpeed*. The maximum loading capacity of a 
*VehicleType* is *maxSpeed*.A *VehicleType* have the safety
